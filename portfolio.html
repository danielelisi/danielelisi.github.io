            <h3>Fastap - Smartwatch Band</h3>
            <h4>Web Development | UX/UI Design</h4>
            <p>Fastap is a prototype for a smart wearable device that can turn any classic watch into a smartwatch. This project has been designed in 3 months for my User Experience/User Interface final assignment. As a team of 2, we followed an iterative approach for our development process, this also included product research, product design, and website development. When we first approached the assignment, we felt overwhelmed about the requirements, details, and the final deliverable but now I can proudly say that we learned valuable knowledge working with something out of our comfort zone. First, we did a market research with user interviews and surveys. This process helped us deciding on product features and product design while integrating UX/UI best practices learned during the course. Once the plan and design process ended, we started developing the website and preparing the final presentation. We surprisingly noticed that our idea was continuously changing during each iteration, we never stop adding ideas and improving already present concepts.</p>

            <p>This ordering software is built in a web app and accessible from any type of device. With this app, customers can view the menu, order, and receive a notification when the order is completed. The employees of the restaurant can access the kitchen page through their personal account to view all the submitted orders, process orders, and flag the completed one to send notifications to customers. The manager can access an admin page to keep track of the amount of orders, view statistics about items in the menu, and keep track of profit and food discarded. As a team of 5, we are following the Agile iterative development process to make sure that at the end of each weekly iteration, we are always deploying working software with additional feature based on our implementation plan. This project is by far the most exciting I took part of. We are continuously learning divide technical workload and assign responsibilities in a small team size; but most importantly, we are learning how to properly interact and communicate with each other to make sure productivity is kept high and that the project stays on track. We decided to use a large variety of toolset for our production including: Node.js, React, PostgreSQL, Amazon Web Services, and GitHub. While everyone in the team contribute on coding backend, frontend and setting up database integrations, each singular team member is also assigned to a specific technology/role; I am currently the repo maintainer on GitHub.</p>
